# Loop over the letters in the word
## At each step in the loop, add the value for that letter
## To find the letter value, check if the letter is in the set of letters for each score, like this:

for letter in word:
      if letter in 'aeilnorstu':
          score += 1
      elif letter in 'dg':
          score += 2
      elif letter in 'bcmp':
          score += 3
      elif letter in 'fhvwy':
          score += 4
      elif letter == 'k':
          score += 5
      elif letter in 'jx':
          score += 8
      else:
          score += 10
## See the full table of letter values in the Instructions.

## Print out the score
