/**
 * DOM(Document Object Model)-Day 3
 *Event Listeners
*
Common HTML events:onclick, 
                   onchange, 
                   onmouseover, 
                   onmouseout, 
                   onkeydown, 
                   onkeyup, 
                   onload. 

We use addEventListener() method to listen different event types on HTML elements.

addEventListener() method takes two arguments, an event listener and a callback function.

*click

*input event and change

*blur event
In contrast to input or change, the blur event occur when the input 
field is not on focus.

*keypress, keydow and keyup
We can access all the key numbers of the keyboard using different 
event listener types.

// change or input event type to get data right away from the input field
