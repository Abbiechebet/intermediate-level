/**
 v8 converts scripts to machine code in frontend the browser JavaSACRIPT
node converts scripts with the help of v8  in the server-side

with node we can access the operating system of a pc

V8 is a browser engine whereas nodejs is built on top of V8 which is a 
runtime environment that gives javascript the power to run at the 
server-side.

node is is easy to use, maintainable and scalable.
scalability - how is it easy to add resources

in microservice architecture -  the services dont talk to each other but 
they take requests from the queue (items in array)

based on the number of requests micreoservices can be scaled up or 
scaled down

services communicate indirectly by messaging the queue

Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task 
isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. 

Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation 
is dependent on the completion of the one before it

javascript is single threaded
node js is multithreaded with the help of event loop and v8 engine
